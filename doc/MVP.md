### 1. Description

The DevOps Team is happy to present the MVP demo of the automatic deployment delivery for the AsciiArtify application.  
The DevOps Team deployed Kubernetes + ArcgoCD. 
**Why Argo CD?**

Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.

Enabling ArgoCD will help the Product team, along with the DevOps Team, to ship features faster and more efficiently.
